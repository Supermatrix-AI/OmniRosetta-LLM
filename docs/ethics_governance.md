# Ethics & Governance

- **Standards Alignment**: UNESCO FAIR, ICOM Open-Heritage, and MIT open collaboration licensing guide the lifecycle of OmniRosetta.
- **Transparency**: Each module captures provenance metadata and exposes interpretable reasoning traces.
- **Privacy**: Datasets and inference endpoints must employ consent-aware access control and auditing.
- **Reproducibility**: Pipelines are containerized and versioned to ensure the scientific method underpins every release.
