# OmniRosetta-LLM
OmniRosetta LLM — An open-source universal intelligence for language, logic, and civilization. Built on the Supermatrix-AI ecosystem, it unites translation, ancient-script decoding, forecasting, and reasoning under ethical UNESCO-FAIR standards for truly global, multilingual AI collaboration.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — Architectural notes, module summaries, roadmap, and contributor information.
- `src/` — Modular AI engines spanning translation, decoding, forecasting, mathematics, architecture, and orchestration helpers.
- `data/` — Placeholder directories for linguistic corpora and mappings.
- `notebooks/` — Demonstration notebooks for decoding, forecasting, translation, and OmniMath utilities.
- `api/` — Lightweight API representation exposing each major capability for downstream integration.

Each module currently includes minimal, dependency-light implementations to help contributors understand the intended interfaces and extend the project incrementally.
